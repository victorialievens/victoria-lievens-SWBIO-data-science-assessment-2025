## Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis Prediction Project

This project contains code for analyzing plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores
to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. This is a different dataset than the one used by group 2 for the group assignments. 

The dataset can be found on Kaggle : "Plasma lipidomics in Alzheimer's disease", published in 2023 by Fereshteh Jozaghkar.
